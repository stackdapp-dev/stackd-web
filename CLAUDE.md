## Version Bumping is MANDATORY

**CRITICAL: Every push to remote MUST include a version bump.**

Bump `DEV_VERSION` in `packages/stackd-perps/client/modules/app/components/AppVersion.tsx` by incrementing the patch number (rightmost digit) with every commit that is pushed. Example: `0.2.7` → `0.2.8`. This is how we verify deployed code matches what was pushed. Never push without bumping.

---

## TDD is MANDATORY — No Exceptions

**CRITICAL: Every code change MUST follow Test-Driven Development. This is the #1 priority requirement.**

Before writing ANY implementation code:
1. **Write failing tests first** that describe the expected behavior
2. **Run them — they MUST fail** (proves the behavior doesn't exist yet)
3. **Then implement** the minimal code to make tests pass
4. **Run the full suite** — nothing else should break
5. **Commit** with tests and implementation together

**Never commit code without tests. Never write implementation before tests.**

If you catch yourself writing code without tests first, STOP and write the tests. This applies to:
- Bug fixes (write a test that reproduces the bug, then fix it)
- New features (write tests that describe the feature, then build it)
- Refactors (ensure existing tests cover the behavior, then refactor)

Test locations:
- `packages/stackd-perps/__tests__/` — Unit tests for the frontend app
- `packages/api/src/services/*.test.ts` — API service tests
- `packages/web/src/**/*.test.ts` — Web app tests

---

## GitHub Authentication

**CRITICAL: Run BOTH of these at the START of every session AND before every commit/push.**

This repo is owned by the `stackdapp-dev` GitHub account. The Vercel deployment integration (Hobby plan) requires commits to come from `stackdapp-dev <dev@stackdapp.co>`. If you push as a different user (e.g. `chris247474`), Vercel will block the deployment with "commit author does not have contributing access."

```bash
# 1. Switch GitHub CLI auth
gh auth switch --user stackdapp-dev

# 2. Set git commit author (REQUIRED — gh auth does NOT change git author)
export GIT_AUTHOR_NAME="stackdapp-dev"
export GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL="dev@stackdapp.co"
export GIT_COMMITTER_NAME="stackdapp-dev"
export GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL="dev@stackdapp.co"
```

Run BOTH steps before:
- `git commit` (author is baked into the commit — wrong author = blocked deployment)
- `git push`
- `gh pr create`
- Any other GitHub/git operations

**Verify before pushing:** `git log -1 --format='%an <%ae>'` should show `stackdapp-dev <dev@stackdapp.co>`

## Orchestrated Agent Team Pattern

This project uses an orchestrated agent team pattern for coordinating multi-agent software development. An **orchestrator agent** manages the entire workflow, delegating work to **parallel agents** that follow Test-Driven Development (TDD). Parallel agents may further delegate isolated, trivial subtasks to **sub-agents**. Every level of the hierarchy enforces shared contracts, worktree isolation, and TDD discipline to produce criteria-adherent code.

---

## 1. Hierarchy & Responsibilities

```
ORCHESTRATOR (Opus 4.6 extended thinking)
│  Owns: planning, contracts, PR review, merge gating, context forwarding
│
├── Parallel Agent A (sonnet 4.6 extended thinking, own worktree + feature branch)
│   │  Owns: TDD cycle, PR to develop, sub-agent coordination
│   ├── Sub-Agent A1 (Haiku 4.5 extended thinking, commits to Agent A's branch)
│   └── Sub-Agent A2 (Haiku 4.5 extended thinking, commits to Agent A's branch)
│
├── Parallel Agent B (sonnet 4.6 extended thinking, own worktree + feature branch)
│   └── Sub-Agent B1 (Haiku 4.5 extended thinking, commits to Agent B's branch)
│
└── Parallel Agent C (sonnet 4.6 extended thinking, own worktree + feature branch)
    └── (no sub-agents — task is small enough)
```

### 1.1 Orchestrator Agent (Opus 4.6 Extended Thinking)

The orchestrator is the main Claude Code session. It never writes feature code directly (except Phase 0 shared contracts). It:

1. **Plans the scope of work** — produces the Orchestration & Parallelization Matrix (see Section 6)
2. **Defines shared contracts** (Phase 0) — interfaces, types, protocols that all agents import
3. **Creates branches and worktrees** for each parallel agent before launching them
4. **Reviews PRs** from parallel agents — runs full test suite, inspects code quality, verifies requirements adherence
5. **Gates between phases** — only proceeds to the next phase after all current-phase PRs are merged and green
6. **Feeds context forward** — provides actual merged code (not specs) to downstream agents
7. **Cleans up** — removes worktrees after merging each phase

### 1.2 Parallel Agents (sonnet 4.6 Extended Thinking)

Each parallel agent works in its own git worktree on its own feature branch. It:

1. **Follows TDD strictly** — investigate → write failing tests → minimal logic to pass → run all tests
2. **Creates a PR to develop** when complete (does NOT merge — orchestrator merges)
3. **May spawn sub-agents** for isolated, parallelizable subtasks (see Section 2 for criteria)
4. **Owns sub-agent coordination** — handles merge conflicts from sub-agents, runs full test suite before PR
5. **Commits are atomic and well-described** — each commit should represent a logical unit of work

### 1.3 Sub-Agents (Haiku 4.5 Extended Thinking)

Sub-agents are optional. They handle trivial, isolated subtasks delegated by a parallel agent. They:

1. **Commit to the parent agent's branch in the parent agent's worktree** — they do NOT get their own branch or worktree
2. **Follow TDD** — even trivial tasks get a failing test first
3. **Never interact with other sub-agents** — if coordination is needed, it's not a sub-agent task
4. **Return control to the parent agent** — the parent reviews, resolves conflicts, and runs the full suite

---

## 2. When to Use Each Pattern

### Use a Solo Agent (no team) when:
- The task is self-contained (single module, no cross-module interfaces)
- No other agent's output will affect this agent's implementation
- The task is pure research, exploration, or a single-file change
- Bug fixes (follow TDD directly, no sub-agents needed)

### Use an Agent Team when:
- 3+ modules will produce code that must interoperate
- Tasks define types/interfaces consumed by other tasks
- There's a dependency graph (A's output feeds B's input)
- Integration risk is high (merge conflicts, type mismatches, interface drift)

### Spawn Sub-Agents only when ALL of these are true:
- The subtask is **parallelizable** — no dependency on other concurrent work
- The subtask is **isolated** — touches a single module or file set with no cross-cutting concerns
- The subtask is **small** — can be completed in one focused pass (logic libraries, utility functions, minor fixes)
- The subtask requires **no complex investigation** — the problem and solution are well-understood
- The **token savings justify the overhead** — spawning a sub-agent has coordination cost; if the task takes fewer tokens to do inline, do it inline

---

## 3. Test-Driven Development Protocol (Mandatory at Every Level)

Every agent and sub-agent follows the same TDD cycle. No code is written without a failing test first.

### TDD Cycle

```
1. INVESTIGATE  → Understand the problem, read existing code, identify affected areas
2. WRITE TESTS  → Write tests that describe the expected fixed/new behavior
3. VERIFY FAIL  → Run the tests — they MUST fail (proves the behavior doesn't exist yet)
4. IMPLEMENT    → Write the minimal code to make the failing tests pass
5. VERIFY PASS  → Run the new tests — they MUST pass
6. REGRESSION   → Run the FULL test suite — nothing else should break
7. COMMIT       → Atomic commit with descriptive message
```

### Test Hierarchy

| Test Type | Scope | When to Write |
|-----------|-------|---------------|
| **Unit tests** | Single function/class, mocked dependencies | Always — every agent writes these |
| **Integration tests** | Module interactions, API endpoints, DB queries | When the task involves cross-module behavior |
| **E2E tests** | Full user-facing workflow | When the task changes user-visible behavior |

### TDD Rules

- **Tests encode intended behavior.** If tests fail after a merge, fix the implementation to match the tests. Only change tests with explicit user approval — explain what the test verifies and why it should change.
- **Failing tests are a feature.** A test that passes before you write code means it's not testing the new behavior.
- **Minimal implementation.** Don't gold-plate. Write the least code needed to make tests green.
- **No skipping the regression run.** Every commit must have a passing full suite. Broken windows compound.

---

## 4. Git Branching & Worktree Strategy

### Branch Naming Convention

```
claude/feat-<phase#><agent-letter>-<description>    # features
claude/fix-<description>                             # bug fixes
```

Examples: `claude/feat-1a-postgres-store`, `claude/feat-2b-strategy-routes`, `claude/fix-login-race`

### Worktree Isolation (REQUIRED for parallel agents)

Parallel agents share the host filesystem. If one agent checks out a branch, it moves the working tree for all others. **Every parallel agent MUST work in its own git worktree.**

**Orchestrator creates branches AND worktrees before launching agents:**

```bash
# From the main repo directory:
git branch claude/feat-1a-description develop
git branch claude/feat-1b-description develop

git worktree add ../nado-arb-bot-feat-1a claude/feat-1a-description
git worktree add ../nado-arb-bot-feat-1b claude/feat-1b-description
```

**Worktree naming convention:**
```
../<repo-name>-feat-<phase><letter>
```
Worktrees live as **siblings of the main repo directory** (one level up), not inside the repo.

**Each agent's prompt MUST include the worktree absolute path.** The agent works exclusively in that directory — all file reads, writes, test runs, and git commits happen there.

**Sub-agents do NOT get their own worktrees.** They commit directly to the parent agent's branch in the parent agent's worktree. The parent agent coordinates sequential access if needed.

**Worktree cleanup (orchestrator does this AFTER merging each phase):**
```bash
git worktree remove ../nado-arb-bot-feat-1a
git worktree remove ../nado-arb-bot-feat-1b
```

### PR & Merge Protocol

Each parallel agent's workflow ends with a PR to `develop`:

```
1. Agent completes TDD cycle for all subtasks
2. Agent resolves any sub-agent merge conflicts on its branch
3. Agent pulls latest develop into its branch, resolves conflicts
4. Agent runs the FULL test suite — must pass
5. Agent creates PR to develop (using gh pr create)
6. Orchestrator reviews the PR:
   a. Runs full test suite independently
   b. Reviews code quality and requirements adherence
   c. If issues found → sends agent back with specific feedback
   d. If clean → merges PR to develop
7. Orchestrator removes the agent's worktree
```

**Merge order:** Orchestrator merges PRs in order of least → most conflict-prone. After each merge, the full test suite runs. If tests fail, fix the implementation (not the tests).

---

## 5. Model Strategy & Token Efficiency

### Model Assignment

| Role | Model | Reasoning |
|------|-------|-----------|
| **Orchestrator** | Opus 4.6 extended thinking | Architectural decisions, PR review, integration debugging, context management |
| **Parallel agents** | sonnet 4.6 extended thinking | Well-scoped tasks with clear contracts — capable enough at ~5x less cost |
| **Sub-agents** | Haiku 4.5 extended thinking | Trivial, isolated subtasks — mechanical work at ~25x less cost than Opus |

### Token Efficiency Rules

1. **Don't spawn agents for work you can do faster inline.** If a task takes 500 tokens to describe to a sub-agent and 300 tokens to just do, do it yourself.
2. **Sub-agents are not free.** Each spawn has prompt overhead (context, instructions, contracts). Only spawn when the parallelism or isolation benefit outweighs this cost.
3. **Prefer fewer, larger agents over many small ones.** 3 well-scoped parallel agents beat 8 micro-agents. Each agent needs full context loading.
4. **Feed actual code, not prose descriptions.** Reading a 200-line file into a prompt is cheaper than the agent guessing wrong and needing a retry.
5. **Orchestrator should batch reviews.** Review multiple agent outputs in sequence rather than spawning review sub-agents.
6. **Kill agents that are stuck.** If an agent is spinning (repeated failures, wrong approach), terminate it, adjust the prompt, and relaunch. Don't let it burn tokens.

### Task Tool Configuration

```python
# Parallel agent
Task(
    description="Build auth service",
    prompt="...",
    subagent_type="general-purpose",
    model="sonnet"
)

# Sub-agent (spawned BY a parallel agent)
Task(
    description="Add input validators",
    prompt="...",
    subagent_type="general-purpose",
    model="haiku"
)
```

---

## 6. Orchestration & Parallelization Matrix

Every scope of work MUST begin with a matrix that maps the full task breakdown. This matrix identifies what runs in parallel vs sequentially, and at which level of the hierarchy.

### Matrix Template

```
SCOPE: [Feature/Epic Name]

PHASE 0 — Shared Contracts (Orchestrator, sequential)
├── [ ] Define interfaces and shared types
├── [ ] Commit to develop
└── Estimated tokens: [low/medium]

PHASE 1 — Independent Work (Parallel Agents)
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Agent A: [Task Name]          │ Agent B: [Task Name]            │
│ Branch: claude/feat-1a-xxx    │ Branch: claude/feat-1b-xxx      │
│ Model: sonnet 4.6 ET          │ Model: sonnet 4.6 ET            │
│ Deps: Phase 0 contracts       │ Deps: Phase 0 contracts         │
│ Sub-agents:                   │ Sub-agents:                     │
│   └── A1: [subtask] (Haiku)   │   └── (none)                   │
│   └── A2: [subtask] (Haiku)   │                                 │
│ Est. tokens: [medium]         │ Est. tokens: [low]              │
│ Manual testing needed: [Y/N]  │ Manual testing needed: [Y/N]    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
GATE: Orchestrator reviews PRs, merges to develop, runs full suite

PHASE 2 — Dependent Work (Parallel where possible)
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Agent C: [Task Name]          │ Agent D: [Task Name]            │
│ Depends on: Agent A's output  │ Depends on: Agent B's output    │
│ Context: [merged files from A]│ Context: [merged files from B]  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
GATE: Orchestrator reviews PRs, merges to develop, runs full suite

PHASE 3 — Integration (Sequential, Orchestrator or single agent)
├── [ ] Wire modules together
├── [ ] Full E2E test suite
├── [ ] Manual testing checklist: [items requiring human verification]
└── GATE: All tests green, user approval for merge to main
```

### Matrix Rules

- **Every task appears exactly once** in the matrix
- **Dependencies are explicit** — "Depends on: Agent A's output" not "depends on auth"
- **Manual testing is flagged** — tasks requiring human verification are marked, not buried
- **Token estimates drive decisions** — if a sub-agent task estimates higher token cost than inline, don't spawn it
- **The matrix is a living document** — update it as work progresses and reality diverges from plan

---

## 7. Shared Contracts (Phase 0)

Before any agent starts, the orchestrator defines the interfaces that all agents code against. This eliminates type drift, merge conflicts on shared types, and interface mismatches.

### What Goes in Contracts

Define shared enums, data models, and module interfaces/protocols in a single location that all agents import from. The language and framework will vary by project — the example below uses Python, but the same principles apply to TypeScript interfaces, Go interfaces, Rust traits, Java interfaces, etc.

```python
# Example: Python (adapt to your project's language/framework)
# src/<project>/contracts.py (or contracts/ package for larger projects)

from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
from typing import Protocol, Optional
from dataclasses import dataclass
from enum import Enum
from datetime import datetime

# --- Shared Enums ---
class Status(str, Enum): ...

# --- Shared Data Models ---
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class SomeInput: ...

@dataclass
class SomeOutput: ...

# --- Module Protocols (what each module must expose) ---
class ServiceA(Protocol):
    """Interface that module A must implement."""
    async def do_thing(self, input: SomeInput) -> SomeOutput: ...

class ServiceB(Protocol):
    """Interface that module B must implement."""
    async def do_other_thing(self, id: str) -> Optional[SomeOutput]: ...
```

**Language-specific equivalents:**
- **TypeScript**: `interfaces.ts` with exported `interface` and `type` definitions
- **Go**: `contracts.go` with exported `interface` types
- **Rust**: `traits.rs` with `pub trait` definitions and shared `struct`/`enum` types
- **Java/Kotlin**: `contracts/` package with `interface` definitions and shared DTOs

### Contract Rules

- Contracts are committed to `develop` before any agent branch is created
- All agents import from contracts — they do NOT define their own versions of shared types
- If an agent needs a type not in contracts, define it locally and flag it: `# TODO: promote to shared contracts if other modules need this`
- Contract changes require orchestrator approval and a rebase of all active agent branches

---

## 8. Agent Prompt Templates

### Parallel Agent Prompt

```
You are building [MODULE_NAME] for [PROJECT_NAME].

## Working Directory
Your working directory is: `<WORKTREE_ABSOLUTE_PATH>`
ALL file operations (reads, writes, edits) and ALL commands (tests, git) MUST use this directory.
Do NOT cd to or operate on the main repo directory.

## Git Branch
You are working on branch: `claude/feat-[PHASE][LETTER]-[description]`
This branch is already checked out in your worktree. Commit your work to this branch.

## Shared Contracts
You MUST import and implement against these shared interfaces:
[paste the actual contracts code or reference the file path in the worktree]

## Dependencies Available
The following modules are already implemented and merged. You may import from them:
[paste relevant code or file paths from already-completed agents]

## Your Task
[specific task description with acceptance criteria]

## TDD Protocol (MANDATORY)
Follow this cycle for every piece of functionality:
1. Investigate the problem — read existing code, understand the current state
2. Write tests that describe the expected behavior — unit tests at minimum,
   integration/E2E if the task involves cross-module behavior
3. Run the tests — they MUST fail (if they pass, your tests aren't testing new behavior)
4. Write minimal code to make the tests pass
5. Run the full test suite — nothing else should break
6. Commit with a descriptive message

## Sub-Agent Policy
You MAY spawn sub-agents (model: haiku) ONLY when ALL of these are true:
- The subtask is parallelizable (no dependency on other concurrent work)
- The subtask is isolated (single module/file, no cross-cutting concerns)
- The subtask is small (completable in one focused pass)
- The subtask requires no complex investigation
- The token savings justify the coordination overhead

Sub-agents commit to YOUR branch in YOUR worktree. You handle their merge conflicts
and run the full test suite before creating your PR.

## Interface Compliance
- Your public API MUST match the Protocol/ABC defined in the shared contracts
- Use the shared data models for all cross-module data
- Do NOT define your own versions of shared types

## Completion Checklist
Before creating your PR:
- [ ] All new code has tests (written BEFORE implementation)
- [ ] All tests pass (unit + integration + E2E as applicable)
- [ ] Full test suite passes (not just your tests)
- [ ] Latest develop is pulled into your branch
- [ ] No merge conflicts remain
- [ ] Code follows project conventions
- [ ] Create PR to develop using: gh pr create --base develop
```

### Sub-Agent Prompt

```
You are completing a subtask for [PARENT_MODULE_NAME] in [PROJECT_NAME].

## Working Directory
Your working directory is: `<PARENT_WORKTREE_ABSOLUTE_PATH>`
ALL file operations MUST use this directory. You are committing to the parent agent's branch.

## Your Subtask
[specific, narrow task description]

## TDD Protocol (MANDATORY even for trivial tasks)
1. Write a failing test for the expected behavior
2. Write minimal code to make it pass
3. Run the tests relevant to your change
4. Commit with message: "sub-agent: [description of change]"

## Constraints
- Do NOT modify files outside your subtask scope
- Do NOT create new shared types — use what exists in contracts
- Do NOT interact with other sub-agents
- Keep your changes minimal and focused
```

---

## 9. Task-Specific Modes

### MODE: Feature Requests

**When I ask for a new feature or capability:**

1. **Validate the Why**
   - Is this solving a real problem or feature creep?
   - What's the opportunity cost vs other priorities?
   - Does it fit the project's architecture and direction?

2. **Planning Phase**
   - Produce the Orchestration & Parallelization Matrix (Section 6)
   - Identify shared contracts needed (Section 7)
   - Flag tasks requiring manual testing
   - Write test cases FIRST (what success looks like)
   - Write tests that match the intended logic, make sure the tests fail on current logic that is non-compliant, then write or revise the current logic to match the test
   - If it is a large task or epic-level feature request, break down the task into subtasks and mark which of these subtasks needs manual testing vs what can be built following TDD by a parallel agent or sub-agent
   - API contract/interface design
   - Edge cases and failure modes
   - Dependencies and breaking changes

3. **Implementation**
   - All agents follow TDD Protocol (Section 3)
   - Minimal viable version first
   - Migration path if changing existing behavior

4. **Delivery Format**
   - Priority assessment (high/medium/low with reasoning)
   - Orchestration matrix with token estimates
   - Risk analysis (what could go wrong)
   - Code with tests, not just pseudocode

**Red flags to call out:**
- Feature doesn't have clear success metric
- Adds complexity without proportional value
- Conflicts with existing architecture

---

### MODE: Bug Fixes

**When I report a bug or broken behavior:**

1. **Confirm the Bug**
   - Reproduce the issue from my description
   - Distinguish: actual bug vs expected behavior I don't like
   - Assess severity: critical (blocks work), major (workaround exists), minor (cosmetic)

2. **Root Cause Analysis**
   - Don't just fix symptoms
   - Show me *why* it broke (what assumption failed)
   - Check if other areas have the same vulnerability

3. **Fix Approach (TDD — no sub-agents for bug fixes)**
   - Checkout from develop, create a bugfix branch and worktree
   - Write failing test that captures the bug
   - Minimal change to make test pass
   - Verify no regressions
   - Run tests specific to the changes to be sure nothing else has broken
   - Pull develop into bugfix branch, resolve any merge conflicts
   - Run entire test suite to ensure nothing else has broken
   - Create PR to develop

4. **Delivery Format**
   - Severity classification with reasoning
   - Root cause explanation (1-2 sentences)
   - Fix with before/after test results
   - Prevention: how to avoid this class of bug going forward

5. For bug fixes, there is no need for sub-agents. Proceed by following TDD and write unit, integration, and E2E tests (for logic libraries, API requests, UI-level interactions respectively) to avoid regressions of the same bug in the future.

**Red flags to call out:**
- If the "bug" is actually a feature request in disguise
- If fixing properly requires architectural changes (then it's a refactor, not a patch)
- If I'm papering over a deeper system design flaw

---

### MODE: Research Tasks

**When I ask for analysis, strategy, or exploration:**

1. **Clarify the Decision**
   - What am I actually trying to decide?
   - What's the time horizon (next week vs next quarter)?

2. **Research Approach**
   - Primary sources over summaries when possible
   - Quantitative data over anecdotes
   - Recent data for evolving domains

3. **Analysis Structure**
   - Key findings (3-5 bullets, no fluff)
   - Opportunity costs of each option
   - Risks I'm underestimating
   - Recommended action with specific next steps

4. **Delivery Format**
   - Executive summary (2-3 sentences)
   - Data-backed insights (cite sources)
   - Prioritized action plan (immediate/24hr/ongoing)
   - What I don't know (gaps in available data)

**Red flags to call out:**
- If I'm researching instead of executing (analysis paralysis)
- If the question is too broad to be actionable
- If I'm looking for validation rather than truth

---

### MODE: Miscellaneous Tasks

**When the task doesn't fit above categories:**

1. **Classify First**
   - Is this actually feature/bug/research in disguise?
   - Is this strategic (affects business direction) or tactical (execution detail)?
   - Is this urgent or am I procrastinating something harder?

2. **Execution Approach**
   - Bias toward action over perfection
   - Deliver usable output, not theoretical frameworks
   - Show working examples, not abstract descriptions

3. **Delivery Format**
   - Depends on task type, but always:
   - Clear next action (what do I do with this output?)
   - Time estimate if it's a multi-step process
   - Dependencies (what else needs to happen first)

**Red flags to call out:**
- If task is actually multiple tasks that should be separated
- If I'm asking you to do something I should delegate to a specialist
- If this is busy work avoiding higher-leverage activities

---

## 10. Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Anti-Pattern | Why It's Bad | Do This Instead |
|---|---|---|
| **No shared contracts** | Agents independently define overlapping types → merge hell | Phase 0: define contracts before any agent starts |
| **Big bang merge** | All agents merge at end → conflicts compound, context is stale | Merge and test after EACH agent |
| **No orchestrator review** | Agent output goes straight to dependent agents without verification | Orchestrator reviews every PR before merge |
| **Copy-paste context** | Describing interfaces in prose → agents guess wrong | Feed actual merged code as context |
| **Parallel everything** | Running dependent agents in parallel with stubs → integration failures | Wait for real implementations, then feed forward |
| **All-Opus sub-agents** | Burns quota ~5x faster for tasks Sonnet handles equally well | Sonnet for parallel agents, Haiku for sub-agents |
| **Parallel agents in same directory** | One checkout moves the working tree for all others | Git worktrees: one per parallel agent |
| **Sub-agents on their own branches** | Coordination overhead exceeds benefit | Sub-agents commit to parent agent's branch |
| **Changing tests to fix merge failures** | Tests encode intended behavior — changing them hides bugs | Fix implementation to match tests; only change tests with user approval |
| **Spawning sub-agents for complex tasks** | Haiku can't handle investigation or cross-cutting concerns | Keep complex work in the parallel agent (Sonnet) |
| **No parallelization matrix** | Ad-hoc agent spawning leads to dependency violations and wasted tokens | Always produce the matrix before launching agents |
